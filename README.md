## Basic Idea
The idea of this project is to simulate fireworks. The fireworks, created with the class Particles, starts from the bottom of the canvas and shoots up to the top. When the fireworks reach a certain height (its y value is less than 150), it explodes into 6 particles. In the real world, the exploded particles are usually the same/similar colours. However, to make my simulation more interesting, I made them into different colours.
This is the initial drawing of my fireworks which I then implemented. Note: the drawing is not to scale.

I also added a cloud in my simulation. The cloud is grey to signify that it is raining (like clouds on a cloudy day). If the firework is below the cloud and it is close to the cloud vertically (its y value is less than 200), the firework will be washed to the ground. The Press me button allows users to add more fireworks.

## Object-Oriented Structure of the Code
There are two classes in my code. The first one is the particle, which is the creation of fireworks, and the second one is the cloud, which creates the cloud.
Each particle instance has 9 properties, they are x, y, x_v, y_v, x_a, y_a, size, color, and, haventExploded. Each initial firework (the red one) starts with the property haventExploded as true, while other fireworks have the property haventExploded as false. We need this property for the algorithm to determine whether or not it should run the explode method (which I will explain more thoroughly later) on the particle. If haventExploded is true, the code will ultimately run the explode method once the y value of the particle reaches a certain number. However, if haventExploded is false, as with the case of all other fireworks, the code will not run the explode method. Hence, these particles will not explode. This is important because, without this property, all the particles will explode over and over again, which is not the case in real fireworks. Methods are actions that can be performed on objects. Particles have three methods, draw, move, and, explode. The draw method draws it onto the canvas, the move method lets it move (move up the canvas), and the explode method lets it explode into multiple particles. The explode method states that if the particle has a y value of less than 150 and its haventExploded property is true, then it should explode. This operation reduces the size of the original particle to 0 while adding 6 new particles around it, and, changes its haventExploded property to false (so that it will not explode again). This makes the simulation look like the original particle has exploded into six new particles. To accomplish this task, we use a method because exploding is an action that is performed on an object -- a particle.
The cloud class is simpler. Each cloud instance only has 4 properties, x, y, x_v, and, size. It has two methods, draw and move. Because the cloud only moves horizontally, the class is much simpler. (Currently, there is only one cloud in my code) One interesting thing is that in order to draw the cloud, I draw five circles next to each other. However, I have to fill in each circle separately to prevent javascript (line 104, 107, 110, 113 and 116 in my javascript file) from thinking I am making a complex shape and including weird holes in my shape

## Model
In my simulation, I used -9.81 / 50 as the value for the constant GRAVITY instead of -9.81. This is because having the gravity of -9.81 would result in the fireworks moving too quickly; hence, it is really difficult to see its changes.
